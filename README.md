# Project Description

Fleetify is a platform to manage all of you fleet vehicles in one place. It tracks the statistics of each vehicle like the income for each month, the mileage and the dates that it is booked. A user will no longer have to log into 4-5 different apps to track their vehicles.

### MVP User Stories

As a user I would want to know what product that I am purchasing. As a user I would like to be able to login to track my fleet vehicles. As a user I would like to be able to know what to do next on the page. As a user, I would like to be able send in questions or schedule a chat before choosing a plan.

## API

I plan on using the google maps API and a vehicle tracking api as a stretch goal.

#### OPTIONAL:

I will have state in the highest componenet possible. I want to steer clear of prop drilling. I will try to use context in certain areas. I will also use json data that I have created instead of spinning up a server.
