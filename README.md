### MVP User Stories

As a user I would want to know what product that I am purchasing. As a user I would like to be able to login to track my fleet vehicles. As a user I would like to be able to know what to do next on the page. As a user, I would like to be able send in questions or schedule a chat before choosing a plan.

## API

I plan on using the google maps API and a vehicle tracking api.

#### OPTIONAL:

I will have state inthe highest componenet possible. I want to steer clear of prop drilling. I will try to use context in certain areas. I will also use json data that I have created instead of spinning up a server.
